This repository features Java implementations of two fundamental AI algorithms:

1. **Nine Soldiers Puzzle Solver**: Utilizes Greedy Best-First Search to solve the Nine Soldiers puzzle by arranging soldiers on a board. It uses `PriorityQueue` for state exploration and a `State` class to manage board configurations and heuristic values.

2. **Astar Delivery Routing**: Implements the A* search algorithm to optimize delivery routes in a city grid. It uses a `PriorityQueue` to manage nodes, a `Node` class for state representation, and a `HashSet` to track visited nodes, aiming to find the shortest path while avoiding obstacles.

Each project demonstrates the application of these algorithms with appropriate data structures for efficient search and optimization.
